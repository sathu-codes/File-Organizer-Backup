Project: File Organizer & Backup

This project demonstrates my Shell Scripting skills by automating file management and backup tasks on Linux systems.

Description:
I developed a script that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their type (e.g., .txt, .jpg) into corresponding folders. Additionally, it creates backup copies of important directories with timestamped folders for easy versioning.

Skills Demonstrated:

  •File operations (ls, mv, cp, mkdir)
  •Variables, loops, and conditional statements
  •Command-line arguments and user input
  •Basic automation and error handling

Outcome:
This script saves time by automating repetitive tasks, ensures data is backed up safely, and showcases my ability to create reliable and efficient shell automation solutions.

Why Hire Me:
This project reflects my practical knowledge of Linux and Bash scripting, giving clients confidence that I can handle shell automation tasks professionally.
